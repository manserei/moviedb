# Movie Database 2017

This is a custom Rails 5 exercise application for my **Ruby on Rails trainings**. It implements a simple **movie database** with three resources:

- Movies
- Actors
- Roles, linking movies and actors together.

It is intended to be a base application to expand and experiment on.


### Recommended reading:

- The [Ruby on Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) are full of useful information on building Ruby on Rails apps. Use these extensively!
- The [Ruby on Rails API Reference](http://api.rubyonrails.org/) documents each and every class and method available in Ruby on Rails.
- The [JBuilder] gem is used to generate JSON responses.
- For tests, this app uses [RSpec] together with [FactoryGirl] (also see its [GETTING_STARTED.md](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_girl/blob/master/GETTING_STARTED.md)) and [FFaker].
- [Capybara] is a framework for acceptance/feature/integration specs. This app uses it in conjunction with [Poltergeist] and [DatabaseCleaner].
